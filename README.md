Final Version 1.0.0 Update:
All functionalities completed.

Comment functionalities and notifications are temporarily dropped.

Possible funcationalies to implement (Easy to hard):

Filter for user searching (age, gender, location, etc.)

Realtime location update in google maps

Realtime event/event member notifications

Please try to make the app look better if you have time.

Look at SampleData.rar if you want to have some sample data to work with. Import the corresponding csv files to your table in MySQL 
workbench after running createDB.sql
