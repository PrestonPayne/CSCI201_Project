Things to note:
Time, Date, and Location classes may not synch up with other peoples choices of libraries for them
I chose the Java.sql.Time for Time and Java.util.Date for date, and android.location.Location
libraries for each of them.

It seems like Date actually has the Time built into it, but wanted to keep Time object just in case
we needed it for another reason.

Location implementation has waited to see if Location was implemented elsewhere (particularly Ayas
portion) so as to make sure that everything matches
