Things to note:
Time, Date, and Location classes may not synch up with other peoples choices of libraries for them
I chose the Java.sql.Time for Time and Java.util.Date for date, and android.location.Location
libraries for each of them.

It seems like Date actually has the Time built into it, but wanted to keep Time object just in case
we needed it for another reason.

Location implementation has waited to see if Location was implemented elsewhere (particularly Ayas
portion) so as to make sure that everything matches

^ a good way to get the current location and to have it update when someome moves - you can pretty
much just copy the code or at least the concepts used there



VERSION 2.0
Server, ServerThread, Client, Query, have all been implemented. As I talked to Jack about, I did not implement any of the stuff regarding
the generation of the mySQL query itself, simply handled it assuming that it more or less worked.

Also there is a good chance that we should be implmeenting a response class as well so that the Client knows what it is looking at so that it can
deal with the objects correctly
